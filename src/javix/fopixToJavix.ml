(** Remarks:
  - When using this compiler from fopix to javix, flap will
    produce some .j files.
    + Compile them to .class via: jasmin Foobar.j
    + Run them with: java -noverify Foobar

  - Final answer:
    your code should contain a final [Ireturn] that should
    return the value of the last DefVal (supposed to be
    an Integer).

  - Function Call Convention:
    + When a function starts, the stack should contain the
      return address (a label encoded as a number, see Labels.encode)
      then the n arguments of the function.
    + The function could freely use an modify any variable. So at least
      the variables that are reused after this call should have
      their contents saved in stack before the call and restored
      afterwards.
    + The function starts by moving its arguments from the stack to
      some variables.
    + When the function returns, the result should be on the top
      of the stack.

  - Boxing:
    The stack could contain both unboxed elements (Java int)
    or boxed elements (Java objects such as Integer or java arrays).
    We place into variables or in array cells only boxed values.
    The arithmetical operations (iadd, if_icmpeq, ...) only works
    on unboxed numbers.
    Conversion between int and Integer is possible via the
    Box and Unboxed pseudo-instructions (translated into correct
    calls to some ad-hoc methods we provide). You may try to
    do some obvious optimisations such as removing [Box;Unbox] or
    [Unbox;Box].

  - Tail-recursive calls : if the body of f ends with a call to
    another function g (which may be f itself in case of recursion),
    no need to save any variables, nor to push a new return address:
    just reuse the return address of the current call to f when
    jumping to g !

  - Variable size and stack size
    Your code should determine the number of variables used by the
    produced code. You might also try to compute the maximum
    stack size when the code is non-recursive or 100% tail-recursive.
